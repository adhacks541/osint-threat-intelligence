Possible (But Require Paid API Keys)
  These platforms are designed for commercial use and require a paid subscription to access their API. If you have 
  a key, they are just as easy to integrate as the ones above.

   * IntelX
   * Pipl
   * SecurityTrails
   * Social-Searcher
   * TinEye

Difficult or Not Feasible
  These are typically desktop GUI applications or interactive frameworks not meant for simple automation, or are 
  just websites without a public API.

   * Maltego: A visual desktop application; cannot be integrated into a web backend.
   * Recon-ng: An interactive framework that's difficult to automate reliably.
   * OSINT Framework: This is a website that links to tools; it's not a tool itself.
   * FotoForensics / DNSDumpster: Websites without public APIs; would require building a web scraper, which is 
     unreliable and likely to break.
